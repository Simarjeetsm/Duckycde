# What is Rubber Ducky?
USB Rubber ducky is an HID device that looks similar to a USB Pen drive. It is a macro keyboard device that automates keystrokes that can type up to 1000 words per minute! Anything that can be done on a keyboard can be done with the Ducky. It may be used to inject keystroke into a system, used to hack a system, steal victims essential and credential data can inject payload to the victimâ€™s computers. The main important thing about USB Rubber ducky is that it cannot be detected by any Anti-Virus or Firewall as it acts as an HID device. But here we are using Arduino boards as USB rubber ducky .
